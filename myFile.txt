With
Lavoisier,
this
man
invented
an
ice
calorimeter,
which
they
used
to
show
that
respiration
was
a
form
of
combustion.
He
corrected
Newtonian
calculations
of
the
speed
of
sound
by
taking
into
account
heat
compression.
This
man
posited
that
if
a
being
knew
the
state
of
the
universe
at
a
given
point
in
time,
then
it
could
predict
the
entire
future
of
the
universe,
a
thought
experiment
known
as
his
demon.
His
namesake
equation
gives
rise
to
spherical
harmonics
and
he
investigated
the
stability
of
the
solar
system.
His
namesake
transformation
is
the
integral
of
zero
to
infinity
of
a
function
of
t
times
e
to
the
negative
st
dt.
For
10
points,
name
this
French
scientist
who
is
the
namesake
of
the
divergence
of
the

written
