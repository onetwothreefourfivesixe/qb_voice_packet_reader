An
attempt
to
reintroduce
the
red
wolf
into
this
park
did
not
achieve
the
success
of
a
previous
attempt
at
the
Alligator
River
National
Wildlife
Refuge.
The
thirty-one
species
of
salamander
found
in
this
park
include
the
red-cheeked
and
the
imitator,
the
latter
of
which
also
lives
in
the
nearby
Plott
Balsams.
The
presence
of
maples
around
this
park's
Mount
LeConte
led
settlers
to
call
the
immediate
area
"The
(*)
Sugarlands."
This
park's
Chimney
Tops
trail
was
closed
in
late
2016
after
a
series
of
wildfires
that
impacted
the
town
of
Gatlinburg.
This
park,
whose
fog
earned
it
its
name,
is
the
most-visited
national
park
in
the
United
States.
For
10
points,
name
this
park
named
for
a
subrange
of
the
Blue
Ridge
Mountains
in
Tennessee
and
North
Carolina.
