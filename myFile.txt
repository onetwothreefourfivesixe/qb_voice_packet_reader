Description
Acceptable
This
event
was
preceded
by
feints
at
Farsia,
Haousa,
and
Jdiryia,
and
resulted
in
the
capture
of
Tah
by
forces
which
camped
at
Sebkha
Oum
Deboaa
three
miles
north
of
the
"dissuasion
line".
This
event
was
preceded
by
the
ruler
of
one
side
falsely
declaring
that
the
International
Court
of
Justice
had
ruled
in
his
favor
on
October
16,
and
the
call
of
a
mahalla.
This
event
followed
a
march
by
350,000
men
and
women,
mostly
civilians,
from
Tarfaya
south,
led
by
Prime
Minister
Ahmed
Oswan,
the
so-called
"Green
March".
On
November
14,
1975,
the
results
of
this
event
were
formalized
through
the
Madrid
Agreement,
which
granted
one-third
of
the
territory
along
the
southern
and
eastern
edges
to
Mauritania,
who
ceded
their
claims
in
1978
after
two
attacks
on
Nouakchott
by
the
Polisario
Front.
For
10
points,
identify
this
event,
which
resulted
in
territory
on
the
northwest
coast
of
Africa
passing
from
Spain
to
a
Maghreb
kingdom.
