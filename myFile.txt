When
deriving
the
Aharonov-Bohm
effect,
it
is
noted
that
the
difference
in
phase
between
the
two
electron
beams
is
invariant
under
this
operation.
This
operation
corresponds
with
rotating
a
vector
for
a
given
quark
in
color
space
in
Yang-Mills
theory.
This
operation,
which
corresponds
to
moving
between
two
different
sections
of
a
principal
bundle,
leads
to
the
conservation
of
(*)
charge
according
to
Noether's
theorem.
These
operations,
which
form
a
Lie
group
of
their
associated
theory,
leave
the
action
invariant.
This
operation
involves
subtracting
the
time
derivative
of
an
arbitrary
scalar
function
from
the
scalar
potential
and
adding
the
gradient
of
that
scalar
function
to
the
vector
potential.
For
10
points,
name
this
type
of
operation
used
in
field
theory
which
modifies
the
potentials
without
changing
the
fields.
