Christfried
Ganander
characterized
this
place,
known
to
some
of
its
inhabitants
as
boasso,
as
comparable
to
Tartarus
combined
with
Ultima
Thule.
Anna-Leena
Siikala
compiled
a
number
of
sources
that
have
tried
to
locate
where
certain
subregions
of
this
place,
such
as
'the
region
of
darkness',
'the
region
of
sleep',
and
Sariola,
might
actually
be
located
in
an
effort
to
definitively
place
this
realm.
This
realm's
Great
Hall
was
the
location
of
great
feasts
held
to
celebrate
the
marriage
of
its
ruler's
daughters,
and
it
is
the
location
of
the
World
Pillar
that
reaches
to
the
North
Star.
One
gift
brought
to
this
realm
in
exchange
for
a
bride
was
hidden
deep
inside
a
mountain
deep
in
this
region
which
led
to
a
time
of
want
that
caused
this
region's
southern
neighbour
to
attack,
ultimately
breaking
the
magic
lid
of
abundance.
This
realm
is
ruled
by
the
Mistress
Louhi,
an
evil
witch
whose
daughters
are
sought
by
such
heroes
from
Vainola
as
Ilmarinen
and
Vainamoinen,
as
recounted
in
the
Kalevala.
For
10
points,
what
is
this
realm
in
Finnish
mythology
located
to
the
far
north
that
is
subject
to
perpetual
cold?
