This
type
of
mathematical
behavior
is
modeled
by
the
differential
equation
dx
over
dt
equals
kx.
The
parent
graph
of
this
type
of
function
has
a
horizontal
asymptote
along
the
x-axis
and,
thus,
cannot
go
negative.
Logarithmic
functions
are
the
(*)
inverse
of
this
type
of
function,
which
is
subject
to
the
shortcut
"rule
of
70."
For
10
points,
give
this
adjective
that
describes
expressions
of
the
form
e
to
the
x,
which
often
indicate
