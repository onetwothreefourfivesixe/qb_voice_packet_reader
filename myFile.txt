This
woman
is
courted
by
Sir
Bromell
la
Pleche,
and
on
two
occasions
is
helped
by
Dame
Brusen.
Called
Perevida
in
Italian
and
also
known
as
Amite
or
Heliabel,
she
lives
for
a
time
in
the
castle
of
Blyaunt
and
earlier
in
a
place
that
Sir
Bors
calls
the
Castle
Adventurous.
She
has
a
showdown
with
another
character,
whom
she
tells
off
for
adultery
and
who
throws
her
out
of
the
latter's
home,
after
the
lover
that
they
share
goes
mad
and
leaps
out
a
window.
She
later
finds
that
man
and
cures
him
with
the
Holy
Grail.
Earlier,
after
being
rescued
from
a
boiling
bath,
this
daughter
of
King
Pelles
is
aided
by
a
magic
spell
that
makes
her
look
like
Queen
Guinevere
so
that
she
can
sleep
with
Sir
Lancelot.
Sharing
her
name
with
the
Lady
of
Astolat,
this
is,
for
10
points,
what
mother
of
Sir
Galahad?
